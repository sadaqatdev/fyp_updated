Cloud-Assisted Resource Allocation Using Machine Learning

A small-scale, end-to-end Python system that learns to allocate cloud/edge tasks to worker nodes using machine learning, and compares it against a greedy baseline.
The pipeline generates data, trains a classifier (Decision Tree selected via cross-validation), persists the model (joblib), and uses it in a Master scheduler to dispatch cloudlets to workers under compute (MIPS) and network (bandwidth/transfer) constraints.

Why: ML-driven scheduling can reduce overall makespan and balance load better than heuristics.

✨ Key Features
	•	Data seeding: synthetic workload generator from a CSV template.
	•	ML training & model selection: Decision Tree vs KNN via cross-validation (70/30 split).
	•	Model persistence: save/load with joblib for real-time inference.
	•	Master scheduler: predicts the best worker for each cloudlet; compares ML vs Greedy.
	•	Metrics: per-worker task log (execution/transfer), duration and makespan.

🚀 Quick Start

0) Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.8+
	•	pip, git

1) Clone

git clone https://github.com/sadaqatdev/fyp_updated.git
cd fyp_updated

2) Create venv & install deps

Linux/macOS

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib

Windows (PowerShell/CMD)

py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib

3) Generate dataset (Seeder)

# Linux/macOS
python3 Cloud/seeder.py
# Windows
py -3 Cloud\seeder.py

Output: Cloud/storage/data/data.csv

4) Train & persist the model (Cloud)

# Linux/macOS
python3 Cloud/cloud.py
# Windows
py -3 Cloud\cloud.py

	•	Performs 70/30 split, cross-validates Decision Tree vs KNN
	•	Saves best model to storage (e.g., model.joblib)

5) Run the scheduler (Edges/Master)

# Linux/macOS
python3 Edges/Master.py
# Windows
py -3 Edges\Master.py

You’ll see per-worker logs and a comparison: ML vs Greedy with durations and makespan.

🔧 Configuration & Where to Edit
	•	Workload generation: Cloud/storage/data/seeder_data_template.csv
	•	Task thresholds / preprocessing: Edges/Cloudlet.py
	•	Workers (MIPS, bandwidth, position): Edges/workers/worker.py
	•	Scheduling logic (ML vs Greedy): Edges/Master.py
	•	Model choices / CV settings: Cloud/cloud.py

⸻

🧪 Reproducible Experiments

Repeat 40 runs & log to file (Linux/macOS)

for i in {1..40}; do python3 Edges/Master.py >> runs.txt; done

Windows (CMD)

for /L %i in (1,1,40) do py -3 Edges\Master.py >> runs.txt

Then parse runs.txt to compute averages of durations/makespan.

🧠 How It Works (Brief)
	1.	Seeder creates task records with features: Position, Instructions (MI), Size (MB), High Priority.
	2.	Cloud reads data.csv, splits 70/30, cross-validates Decision Tree vs KNN, trains the best, and saves model.joblib.
	3.	Master loads the model, receives cloudlets, and predicts the best Worker (considering compute & link costs).
	4.	Simulation prints per-worker assignments, execution/transfer time, total duration, and overall makespan.
	5.	Comparison against Greedy shows the benefit of ML-driven scheduling.

📊 Example Output (abridged)

****************************ML******************************
------------------WORKER--------------------
position 2 | MIPS: 2.6 | Duration: 987.6 s
...
------------------WORKER--------------------
position 3 | MIPS: 3.0 | Duration: 836.6 s
...
**************************Greedy****************************
position 3 | MIPS: 3.0 | Duration: 1020.1 s
...

Takeaway: ML often reduces makespan and balances load vs Greedy.

🔭 Relation to Federated Learning (FL)

This scheduler’s task→worker decision maps to client→round selection in FL at the edge.
The same resource-aware ideas (compute, bandwidth, priority, transfer cost) help reduce time-to-accuracy and mitigate stragglers in FL systems.

⸻

❓ Troubleshooting
	•	ModuleNotFoundError: install deps — pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib
	•	FileNotFoundError: data.csv: run Seeder first and execute commands from repo root
	•	Windows paths: use backslashes (Cloud\cloud.py) or run in WSL
	•	Non-determinism: add random_state in cloud.py for fixed splits

✅ Requirements
	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Packages: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, joblib
